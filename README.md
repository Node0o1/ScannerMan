# ScannerMan
**Simple Domain Reconnaissance Scanner**

### Types of Scans currently supported
- Sub Domain
- Filepath
- Port

#### Description
> Very basic menu-driven, multi-threaded scanner tool written in Python and easy to use. Incorporates the use of a dictionary for path scans using the requests library and a range based port scan using Python sockets.
> Works on linux and Windows operating systems. 
> Many like it exist, but I wanted to build my own tool which offers ease of use and high efficiency. I may add more capabiltiy such as more scan types and CLI -tag options for single line use in the command line environment for more advanced users.

### A few things to note:
- Python 3.11+ is required to run
- Pip must be installed and python should be added to Path
- after downloading run the following:
..- `python -m pip install requirements.txt` or `python3 -m pip install requirements.txt` depending on your environment.
