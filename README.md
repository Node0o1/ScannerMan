# ScannerMan
**Simple Domain Reconnaissance Scanner**

### Types of Scans currently supported
- Sub Domain
- Filepath
- Port

#### Description
> Very basic menu-driven, multi-threaded scanner tool written in Python and easy to use. Incorporates the use of a dictionary for path scans using the requests library and a range based port scan using Python sockets.
> Works on linux and Windows operating systems. 
> Many like it exist, but I wanted to build my own. I may add more capabiltiy such as more scan types and CLI -tag options for single line use in the command line environment.
