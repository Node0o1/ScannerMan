#### Description
> Very basic multi-threaded scanner tool and easy to use. Incorporates the use of a dictionary for path scans using the requests library and a range based port scan using Python sockets.
> Works on linux and Windows operating systems. 
> Many like it exist, but I wanted to build my own. I may add more capabiltiy such as more scan types and CLI -tag options for single line use in the command line environment.
